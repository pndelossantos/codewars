//Instructions
// This method, which is supposed to return the result of dividing its first argument by its second, isn't always returning correct values. Fix it.


//Solution
// to variables x and y each of which contains a number
// return the result of x divided by y in the form of an integer
// ((4,2) 2)
// Uses the / operator and the arrow function syntax to return the result of x divided by y
const solve = (x, y) => x / y
